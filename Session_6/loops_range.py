# Imagine a teacher checking your answer sheet
# Take one paper
# Check it, move to the next
# STop when paerps are finished

# loop variable in (0,1,2,3,4)
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# repeat 3 times
# each time print checked
# python handles the counting


# you don't need to mention the counts

#print 1 to 10

for i in range(1,11):
    print(i)

# print (1,3,5,7,9)
for i in range(1, 10, 2):   # start, stop, step
    print(i)

# print negative numbers from -1 to -5

for i in range(5, -3, -1):
    print(i)
